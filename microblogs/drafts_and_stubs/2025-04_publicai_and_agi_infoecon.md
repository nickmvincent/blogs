# Public AI and Information Economics

Extremely micro version:

Data can be broadly described as having non-rival and non-excludable properties. One simple way to put this, IMO, is that data labor is like cartographic labor -- everyone can read the map at once (and benefit from not running their ship ashore, falling off a cliff, etc.) and it's really hard to enclose the map (if there's a copy up in the town square, it can be hard for cartographers to get paid for future cartographic labour).

For areas of life that are more dynamic, this is less of an issue (data goes stale, need fresh data, can make moeny for doing "mapping").

Data markets suffer from Arrow information paradox: if I want to buy data to use, I don't know the exact value I get until I see it and train on it. If I want to sell data, once I let a consumer try a sample I can't "retract it" or prevent them from sharing with their friends (barring regulation). So, suboptimal market outcomes.

However, information often provides utility because it allows you take an action in a zero-sum game, this is not public goods. This is very rivalrous. E.g. scraping the web to do risky high frequency trading.

Warm and fuzzy examples of AI (it's like a library, personalized chatbots teaching us all to become mathematical savants and culturally enriched Renaissance-People) lean into public goods framing. Library is a public good (but not always -- if the library hosts a treasure map, only the person who finds the treasure map and gets to the treasure first gets utility -- ultra rivalrous).

## Ok, what about AGI?

If we actually have systems that reason and make actuated real world decisions (hooked up to API or hooked up to literaly gears and motors, i.e. doing stuff in the world) these AGI systems will actually "consume" the treasure in the treasure maps, make trades in the market, etc. They might also provide library-like public goods, but the dominant effect will not be the provision of public goods.

Better, IMO, to have human in the loop (many agree!), which means its not AGI, it's data-dependent tooling / assistance.
