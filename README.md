 Track blog posts I've written


The `archived` folder contains copies of blog posts that are published elsewhere (mainly, substack).

The `ideas.md` file contains is a live, public notes doc that tries to link together specific ideas that appear in my work with various papers, microblogs, other contributions, etc.

The `microblogs` folder contains some short microblogs (link round-ups I shared publicly, course highlights).
